## Project Overview

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). The project is a website that appears to be in the early stages of development. It is built with [React](https://react.dev/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). The project also includes a `legacy-site` directory, which may contain a previous version of the website.

The `site-next` directory contains the main Next.js application. The `app` directory contains the main application logic, including the layout and pages. The `components` directory contains reusable React components. The `public` directory contains static assets, such as images and fonts.

## Building and Running

To build and run the project, you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.

1.  Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2.  Run the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
3.  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Development Conventions

The project uses [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for linting and [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for testing. The configuration for these tools can be found in the `eslint.config.mjs` and `jest.config.js` files, respectively. The project also uses [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static typing. The configuration for TypeScript can be found in the `tsconfig.json` file.
